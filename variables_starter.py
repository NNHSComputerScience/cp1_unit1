# VARIABLE:

'''
#   Follow all variable naming rules and conventions:

# Rules for legal variable names:
#  - Contain only numbers, letters, and underscores
#  - Can’t start with a number
#  - Can’t be a reserved keyword in Python (print, input, type, etc.)

# Guidelines for good variable names:
#  - Be descriptive of a variable's contents
#  - Be consistent with formatting
#  - Follow conventions: 
#     - names that begin with an underscore have a special meaning
#     - don’t begin with a capital letter 
#  - Consider the trade-off of long names

# ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT: 
# ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR: 

# INPUT function - 

# CONCATENATION: 

# string repetition


# Numbers types in Python - 2 new TYPES:
#   INTEGER(int) - 
#   FLOATING POINT NUMBER (float) - 

# Built-in functions to convert types:
#   str() converts to a string
#   int() converts to an int
#   float() converts to a float

# nesting functions:

input("\n\nPress enter to process calculations...")
print("---------------------------------------")
num1 = 0
num2 = 0
# Math Operators:
#   + , - , / , //, * , ** , % 

# addition
result = num1 + num2
print(num1, "+", num2, "=", result)  
# subtraction

# true (floating point) division

# integer division - leaves off remainder

# multiplication

# exponents
 
# modulus - gives the remainder


 
# STATEMENT - 
# EXPRESSION - 

print("\nThanks for using the Python calculator. Re-run program for new numbers.")
